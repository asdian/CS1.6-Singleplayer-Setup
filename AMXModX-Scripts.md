> A RAW file (uncompiled) before `.amxx` is in `.sma` format. We need a software to properly create or modify, then compiling it into an `.amxx`.

### Setting up working space
1. Download the AMX Mod X scripting package [here](https://www.amxmodx.org/downloads-new.php) (or [here](https://www.amxmodx.org/downloads-new.php?branch=master) for the newest available).
2. Create and place the files into your project folder. Here's the example:

> [!TIP]
> I recommend to not put the files inside the CS1.6 installation folder, in case when you need to clean install the game it saves you the hassle from doing backups.

#### Now, let's set up our scripting software. There are two softwares that I've used for making AMX Mod X scripts.

> ### Easy Way / Advanced Way

> #### The easy way is using AMX Mod X Studio. A lightweight software for AMX Mod X scripting.

3. Download the AMX Mod X Studio from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/amxmodx/files/AMX%20Mod%20X%20Studio/1.4.3%20final/AMXX_Studio_1.4.3_final.zip/download). It's a portable software, you just have to extract it.
4. Place it somewhere. `Example: D:/Projects/CS1.6/AMX Studio/(here)`
5. Open `AMXX_Studio.exe`
6. Go to `Tools` -> `Settings`
